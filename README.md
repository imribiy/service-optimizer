Service optimizer is a program that is more compact than serviwin in terms of functionality and is designed only to disable services.

The application is divided into two tabs: Services currently running and Services with automatic startup.
Thanks to the logging function you can also see the startup type of the service before it was disabled.
It can automatically detect services with a name ending like _123abc2 and disable them in an effective way (you cannot do this with serviwin or through the services.msc interface)
